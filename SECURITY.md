# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The master branch reflects what is currently deployed to the trigpoiting.uk website.

Any security issues with the API code will be attended to as quickly as possible.

The frontend code is considered lower priority for security issues, as there is no server
side rendering. However any vulnerabilities which could impact users' personal data will
be looked into as a matter of priority.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please raise an Issue (or ideally PR) for any security issues affecting the main branch.
